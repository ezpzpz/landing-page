# landing-page
This was my first attempt at making a landing page. 

It definitely took some time and effort to achieve this but the results were very worthwhile.
This project helped solidify my knowledge I have so far of css and html.
It also helped my learn flexbox more in-depth while learning how to make a full webpage.
